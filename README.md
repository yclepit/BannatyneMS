Bannatyne MS Website
The Bannatyne MS [Adv. MS. 1.1.6], c. 1568, is the largest extant collection of late medieval Scottish verse. It comprises over 400 separate pieces of text, divided into five thematic sections: theology, morality, comedy, love and fables. To date the manuscript has been accessible in limited print edition and facsimile, however the recent acquisition of NLS images by the Project Europeana at the IIIF has opened up new possibilities.
